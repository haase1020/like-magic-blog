What a year it has been!!

### Programming Boot Camps and Pandemics

---

Little did I know when I started my journey in December 2019 to learn programming that the world would soon face a global pandemic. I still remember a meeting with my web-dev buddies a few months into my boot camp. "There's no more toilet paper‚Ä¶." Huh???

Despite a raging pandemic that has slowed down the pace of life for my family (no more outings, shopping trips, going to Japanese School on Saturdays, etc.), I feel like this past year has flown by like a shinkansen. Why did this year seem to go by so quickly?

After some reflection, I think I have pinpointed the key reasons:

- This year is the first year in 14 years I am focusing intently on something other than homeschooling (software development).
- I have been working/ studying full-time every day since I started boot camp in December 2019.
- Not driving around has kept me focused on learning goals rather than traffic.
- A sense of urgency of needing to "make up for lost time," having started programming as a career change.

### Homeschooling and Working Full-time üñ•Ô∏è

---

When I started Lambda School, I struggled with feelings of guilt for not spending as much time with my children as I had up to that point. My time was limited to the mornings before 11 am (living on the East Coast worked out well since my classes didn't start until 11 am EST). My children had been accustomed to having me work with them all day, and when I started programming, I had to be willing to say, "I will have to check your work later" when my studies began. At first, my children were unsure of how to proceed. However, as they grew accustomed to finding out the answers themselves - whether it was reading through the answer key on math problems they were stuck on, or looking up a subject on the Internet, or doing research papers on topics they chose and did the research on - I noticed my children were taking ownership of their learning much more than when I had been there as a safety net. They had to struggle on their own to find the answers or ask each other when they got stuck. They learned how to work independently and also how to work interdependently, helping each other.

### Learning Takes Various Forms ‚ú®

---

Their studies have also broadened beyond the purely academic. I have never been much into cooking, and now with a full-time job, some days I don't get around to making meals. Initially, my children whined at the lack of food prep on my part, but then I gently suggested that they use my business as an opportunity to learn how to cook. I showed them simple ways to prepare nutritious food. I asked them to make menus and a list of grocery items needed to make the menu items. I have been amazed that my nine-year-old daughter can now make food I never thought possible!

My children also have learned how to care for younger children as they take turns watching my youngest son for an hour at a time, starting at 11 am. I admit, there have been some growing pains with watching my son. I have pointed out (sometimes with a little less grace than I would like) that watching movies for prolonged periods or playing video games while watching my son is probably not great for his development. At first, I took a critical approach, reprimanding my children for not limiting screen time when watching my youngest. However, what has worked best is showing my children data. I pointed them to the website 1000 hours outside, which has excellent resources on why kids need more time outdoors. I have shown my children data on the benefits of reading to children and the positive effects my older children derive from teaching another child. While some days there is still more screen time than I would like, on the whole, I have been impressed by how responsibly the older kids care for their brother. I also use an allowance system, giving the children monthly payment for helping me watch little bro. My husband also got my children debit cards, to which we apply their monthly payment. The kids are in charge of buying all non-essentials (makeup for my teenage daughter, lights and gaming setup for my son, and extra fun books and clothes for my younger daughter). Since the kids use their debit cards to buy things they want, they are much more hesitant to spend their money. They are also learning how to check their account balances. My husband is even showing them how to invest their money.

### Saving Money and Time

---

Quitting Japanese School this year was a tough decision. I will speak about that in future blog posts, but while it was hard to say goodby to Japanese School, that has been a fantastic decision for our family. It has freed us up financially to buy more Japanese books, save more money, and have our Saturdays back. Plus, I notice the kids enjoy learning Japanese more now that they don't feel the pressure of numerous tests every Saturday (no more sounds of crying on Saturday morning and panic attacks before kanji tests).

### Inspiring Work

---

Working at Prenda has also been a HUGE positive for me this year. I am surrounded by some of the most thoughtful people I have ever met that genuinely want to inspire children to love learning. One book that several Prenda employees have recommended is "Free To Learn: Why Unleashing the Instinct to Play Will Make Our Children Happier, More Self-Reliant, and Better Students for Life" by Peter Gray. During Christmas vacation, I finally set aside time to read this incredible book. This book put down in writing the thoughts I have mulled over the past few years as a homeschooling mom. Here are some of my key takeaways from this book:

Trustful parents are not negligent but provide "not just freedom, but also the sustenance, love, respect, moral examples, and environmental conditions required for healthy development. They support, rather than try to direct, children's development by helping children achieve their own goals when such help is requested." The other two parenting styles, directive-domineering, and directive-protective parenting) are oriented toward directing children's behavior and development rather than allowing children to direct themselves.

The author identified seven "sins" of forced education:

- Denial of liberty without just cause and due process
- Interference with the development of personal responsibility and self-direction
- Undermining the intrinsic motivation to learn
- Judging students in ways that foster shame, cynicism, and cheating
- Interference with the development of cooperation and promotion of bullying
- Inhibition of critical thinking
- Reduction in diversity of skills and knowledge

The author also reinforced some of the reasons I love homeschooling so much:

- Children have access to knowledgeable and caring adults
- Children can feel free to exchange ideas without being made fun of
- Children are free from bullying

### A Side Note About Video games

---

As a side note, the author had some surprising insights on video games:

- Kids like video games because they have freedom, self-direction, and competence.
- Video games are not the problem. They can be excellent sources of learning and enjoyment. The route to make sure kids have real opportunities to play freely outdoors, with other kids, without adults' interference.

Finally, the author touched on having mixed aged children when learning:

- Free age-mixing is important - kids can learn from each other
- Older children learn to nurture and lead
- Kids learn through teaching each other
- Younger children invoke creative-enhancing effects

Free to Learn was a joy to read, and I highly recommend this book for those considering homeschooling or who want to consider what education can and ought to be. It doesn't have to be just homeschooling - Prenda offers micro-schools, which is a wonderful option for providing a nurturing, caring environment for children to learn.

### Conclusion

---

As I look back on this year, my children and I have grown leaps and bounds. I will always remember 2020 as a year of growth and discovery - discovering our passions, growing in our independence as learners (both the children and mommy!), and espousing one of my favorite core values that Prenda holds - learning over comfort.

As I say sayonara to 2020 and hajimemashite to 2021, I anticipate what new exciting adventures lie ahead. Finally, thank you to everyone who inspired and encouraged me this year! I am so thankful for the fantastic people I have been blessed to interact with this year.
I look forward to working/ learning/ growing with you all in the coming year!
