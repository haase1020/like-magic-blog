## My Blogging Journey Begins

<p>
  Hello world! I am so glad that you have decided to visit my blog. After many
  months of dreaming about creating my very own blog, here I am! I have finished
  my Gatsby.js website and am eager to share my new blog with you.
</p>

### Once Upon a Time, Not Too Long Ago…

<p>
  I began my journey into the world of tech last winter (2019). My husband and I
  had decided to take a road trip to Chicago to visit the grandparents. We drove
  13 hours straight with four children (driving at night worked great!) and
  safely reached our destination. Little did I know that this road trip would
  result in. It was during our week vacation that I decided I needed to make a
  change in my life.
</p>
<p>
  As a homeschooling mother of four children who also worked as a Japanese
  translator on the side, I was not lacking in things to do. Neither did I
  dislike what I was doing at the time - I am super passionate about Japanese
  and LOVE that I get to homeschool my kids. However, I felt as if I was hitting
  a wall. Technology seemed to be evolving at the speed of light all around me,
  and I hardly knew what it was all about. Translation was a fine pursuit, but I
  was making a little more than minimum wage doing work of which the future is
  uncertain. Up to that point, I had been a happy consumer of technology, but I
  could not suppress the little voice in my head that kept asking me, “wouldn’t
  it be cool to create apps instead of just using them?” I wanted to make the
  transition to also being a producer of technology. Although the thought of
  making a career change was more than a little daunting, I knew I would regret
  not trying to learn about programming. So I began seeking for ways to learn.
</p>
<p>
  I had dabbled in the past with “creating” websites. I wanted to make a website
  for my daughter and her dog walking business. So I tried using Wix. Don't get
  me wrong. Companies like Wix are a great way for people to make websites
  without having programming knowledge. However, as I tinkered with my
  daughter's website, I found myself wanting to understand MORE. I wanted to
  understand the whole business of website creation. I wanted to understand more
  about how the Internet worked. At that point, programming was like magic to
  me, and I wanted to start peeling away those layers of mystery to know what
  lay beneath.
</p>

### Learning How To Program

<p>
  After searching for ways to start learning, my husband suggested I look into
  the program at Lambda School. What was appealing about Lambda School was the
  income share agreement. That meant no tuition payments upfront and that I
  didn't start paying until I got a job making over a certain threshold. For a
  person like me who had already paid for college three times over (bachelors
  and two master's degrees), the ISA was VERY appealing.
</p>
<p>
  I began my studies at Lambda School in December 2019. What followed were nine
  months of some of the most intensive learning I have done in my life. I'll be
  frank. For someone new to the world of programming, Lambda School is HARD.
  There were many times I questioned my ability to continue. "I've taken on too
  much!" I would lament (usually in tears of frustration) to my husband on
  several occasions. He assured me I would be fine, and I just needed to keep
  moving forward. "Whatever you do, don't give up." His repeated advice became
  my mantra as the months rolled on.
</p>
<p>
  I successfully completed the Lambda School full-stack developer program and
  began my software internship this summer (2020). Some days I have to pinch
  myself to remember that I am not dreaming. I really am working as a software
  engineer. I love the work I do now and wake up every morning excited about the
  coding challenges I get to tackle. I have never felt as passionate about a
  career as I do in my current profession.
</p>
<p>
  The cool part is the journey to becoming a software engineer is I can still
  pursue other interests I am passionate about. Granted, I have less time to
  spend learning Japanese or homeschooling. However, that restricted time has
  forced me to be more deliberate with my time, cherishing each minute I have.
  Previously, I let homeschool drag on too long during the day. Far too often, I
  went too far in micromanaging my children's studies. Now, I give them a great
  deal of autonomy. Yes, I provide them with what they need to do and the
  resources necessary to get their studies done. What has changed is I have
  stopped handholding. I let them take responsibility for their learning, rather
  than carrying that responsibility entirely upon myself.
</p>
<p>
  My children were at first a little confused by these changes. However, the
  result has been amazing to witness. They have grown to be more autonomous and
  independent. By giving them the freedom to learn how they choose to learn,
  they are developing skills they will use throughout their lifelong learning
  adventures.
</p>

### Like Magic

<p>
  I have started this blog to share my journey - however crazy, wild, and at
  times hectic it will be. I want to share because I hope to encourage anyone on
  the fence about taking on a new challenge that the sky's the limit! I am
  amazed every time I get a program to work, or understand a new coding skill.
  That is why I have named my blog “Like Magic”. Technology is a little bit like
  magic, where we get to actually converse with computers!
</p>

### The Ongoing Journey

<p>
  The worst thing we can do in life is to resign ourselves to our current
  situation if we are not content. It is never too late to start learning
  something new! Learning is an epic adventure, and I look forward to sharing my
  journey and also hearing about the journeys of each reader .
