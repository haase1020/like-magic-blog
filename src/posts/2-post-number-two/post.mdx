### Programming Boot Camps and Pandemics

What a year 2020 was!!

Little did I know when I started my journey in December 2019 to learn
programming that the world would soon face a global pandemic. I still remember
my web-dev buddies marveling in one of our evening standups a few months into
my boot camp. "You can't buy toilet paper anywhereâ€¦." I was shocked. I hadn't
realized that in the span of a few days, the world's supply of toilet paper
would fail to meet the needs of a panicked world facing Covid-19.

Despite the raging pandemic that forced my family to slow down our pace of daily life in some ways (shopping trips, going to Japanese School on Saturdays, etc.), I feel like this past year has flown by like a _shinkansen_. Why did this year seem to go by so quickly?

After some reflection, I have pinpointed the key reasons:

âœ… This year is the first year in 14 years I am focusing intently on something other than homeschooling (software development).

âœ… I have been working/ studying full-time every day since I started boot camp in December 2019.

âœ… Not driving around has kept me focused on learning goals rather than traffic ðŸš—.

âœ… I have felt a sense of urgency of needing to "make up for lost time," having started programming as a career change.

### Homeschooling and Working Full-time

---

When I started Lambda School, I struggled with feelings of guilt for not spending as much time with my children as I had up to that point. My time was limited to the mornings before 11 am (living on the East Coast worked out well since my classes didn't start until 11 am EST). My children had been accustomed to having me work with them all day, and when I started programming, I had to be willing to say, "I will have to check your work later" when my studies began. At first, my children were unsure of how to proceed. However, as they grew accustomed to finding out the answers themselves - whether it was reading through the answer key on math problems they were stuck on, or looking up a subject on the Internet, or doing research papers on topics they chose and did the research on - I noticed my children were taking ownership of their learning much more than when I had been there as a safety net. They had to struggle on their own to find the answers or ask each other when they got stuck. They learned how to work independently and also how to work interdependently, helping each other.

### Learning Takes Various Forms

---

Their studies have also broadened beyond the purely academic. I have never been much into cooking, and now with a full-time job, some days I don't get around to making meals (please don't judge me!). Initially, my children whined at the lack of food prep on my part, but then I gently suggested that they use these situations as an opportunity to learn how to cook. I showed them simple ways to prepare nutritious food. I asked them to make menus and a list of grocery items needed to make the menu items. We gathered together and came up with a plan of action. We had breakfast covered (so thankful for toast and peanut butter!). Lunch was also easy - typically rice, miso soup, and a side dish. Dinner was where my daughters flexed their culinary muscles. Although our meals are simple, we make sure that we eat plenty of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and protein. I have been amazed that my nine-year-old daughter can now make food I never thought possible!

My children also have learned how to care for younger children as they take turns watching my youngest son for an hour at a time, starting at 11 am. This was the most challenging issue to tackle with me starting work full-time. I have pointed out (sometimes with a little less grace than I would like) that watching movies on YouTube for prolonged periods or playing video games while watching my son is probably not great for his development. At first, I took a critical approach, reprimanding my children for not limiting screen time when watching my youngest. However, rather than being critical, I have found that what works best is showing my children data on how their actions impact them individually and their little brother. We have researched articles about kids and screens (for example, [this article](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2020/04/cover-kids-screens)), and my children have come to understand that too much screen time is not a good thing. Recently, a colleague at Prenda shared a fantastic website: [1000 Hours Outside](https://www.1000hoursoutside.com/). This website provides excellent reasons why kids need more time outdoors (developing creativity, positively impacting brain functions and physical health, and so much more!). I have shown my children data on the benefits of [reading aloud to children](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/well/family/reading-aloud-to-young-children-has-benefits-for-behavior-and-attention.html) and the positive effects my older children derive from teaching others ([Feynman Technique](https://medium.com/taking-note/learning-from-the-feynman-technique-5373014ad230)). While some days there is still more screen time than I would like, on the whole, I have been impressed by how responsibly the older kids care for their brother. I also use an allowance system, giving the children monthly payment for helping me watch little brother. My husband also got my children debit cards, to which we apply their monthly payment. The kids are in charge of buying all non-essentials (makeup for my teenage daughter, lights and gaming setup for my son, and extra fun books and clothes for my younger daughter). Since the kids use their debit cards to buy things they want, they are much more hesitant to spend their money. They are also learning how to check their account balances. My husband is even showing them how to invest their money.

### Saving Money and Time

---

My children homeschool bilingually - in English and Japanese. My oldest son was born in Japan, and from infancy, we have been learning Japanese together. I still remember cramming in my Japanese study time during his naps to improve my Japanese language skills and reading an insane amount of Japanese picture books to him as a young child.

He started attending Japanese School (a school held on Saturdays for Japanese students living outside of Japan) from the age of five. He faithfully attended Japanese School up to graduation from Junior High. My two other older children also faithfully attended Japanese School. Then the pandemic hit. After many hours of contemplation, I decided that we were going to stop attending Japanese School. The reasons were:

ðŸ˜Ÿ The cost of attending was more than I paid for all other learning combined.

ðŸ˜Ÿ We had failed to develop relationships with other students (for me, other parents) at the new Japanese School we were attending.

Quitting Japanese School this year was a tough decision. I will speak about that in future blog posts, but while it was hard to say goodby to Japanese School, while difficult, stopping Japanese School has been a fantastic decision for our family. It has freed us up financially to buy more Japanese books, save more money, and have our Saturdays back as a family. Plus, I notice the kids enjoy learning Japanese more now that they don't feel the pressure of numerous tests every Saturday (no more sounds of crying on Saturday morning and panic attacks before kanji tests).

### Inspiring Work

---

Working at [Prenda](https://prendaschool.com/) has been a HUGE blessing for me this year. I am surrounded by some of the most thoughtful, intelligent people I have ever met in my new job. Working in a place where you genuinely feel happy is SO important in life. Think about it. If you are working full-time, you spend the majority of your life at work. If you work in an environment where you don't feel happy, that means the majority of your time will be drudgery. However, if you work in an [environmment you enjoy](https://www.inc.com/rhett-power/10-reasons-why-it-is-important-create-a-happy-workplace.html#:~:text=Employees%20who%20genuinely%20enjoy%20their,for%20both%20employee%20and%20employer.), work becomes a joy.

Everyone that works at Prenda genuinely wants to inspire children to love learning. One book that several Prenda employees have recommended is _[Free To Learn: Why Unleashing the Instinct to Play Will Make Our Children Happier, More Self-Reliant, and Better Students for Life](https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/peter-gray/free-to-learn/9780465084999/)_ by Peter Gray. During Christmas vacation, I finally set aside time to read this incredible book. The author eloquently describes many of my thoughts as a homeschooling mom. Here are some of my key takeaways from this book:

Trustful parents are **NOT** negligent. They provide "not just freedom, but also the sustenance, love, respect, moral examples, and environmental conditions required for healthy development. They support, rather than try to direct, children's development by helping children achieve their own goals when such help is requested." The author identifies the other two parenting styles (directive-domineering and directive-protective parenting) oriented toward directing children's behavior and development rather than allowing them to direct themselves.

The author identified seven "sins" of forced education:

ðŸ˜Ÿ Denial of liberty without just cause and due process

ðŸ˜Ÿ Interference with the development of personal responsibility and self-direction

ðŸ˜Ÿ Undermining the intrinsic motivation to learn

ðŸ˜Ÿ Judging students in ways that foster shame, cynicism, and cheating

ðŸ˜Ÿ Interference with the development of cooperation and promotion of bullying

ðŸ˜Ÿ Inhibition of critical thinking

ðŸ˜Ÿ Reduction in diversity of skills and knowledge

The author also reinforced some of the reasons I love homeschooling so much:

ðŸŒ± Children have access to knowledgeable and caring adults

ðŸŒ± Children can feel free to exchange ideas without being made fun of

ðŸŒ± Children are free from bullying

This book is a must-read for anyone that wants to rethink education and learning. To raise children who will thrive in today's fast-changing world, we HAVE to give them the freedom to decide what they want to learn. We need to trust our children, acting as mentors and coaches, but NOT force-feeding them what we arbitrarily decide they should learn.

### A Side Note About Video games

---

As a side note, the author had some surprising insights on video games. These insights caught me a bit off guard and challenged my views of gaming. I have to admit - I am NOT a gamer, and personally don't like video games. They have no appeal for me; I would much rather be cuddled up with a cup of coffee and a good book. However, my kids love them. I have worried that gaming is adversely affecting them, but also hesitated to completely cut gaming from our lives because the kids really do enjoy their game time. Author Peter Gray wrote the following about video games:

âœ… Kids like video games because they have freedom, self-direction, and competence.

âœ… Video games are not the problem. They can be excellent sources of learning and enjoyment. The route to make sure kids have real opportunities to play freely outdoors, with other kids, without adults' interference.

These insights forced me to think about the options I provide for my children besides gaming. If given a choice to play outside versus play video games, what would my children choose? The younger children would pick playing outside with friends in a heartbeat. The issues are two-fold:

âœ… Providing healthy, appealing alternatives to gaming

âœ… Teaching children why they need to [self-regulate](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/10/stanford-psychology-expert-biggest-parenting-mistake-is-not-teaching-kids-this-important-skill.html) game time

### Learning With Children of Mixed Ages is Beneficial

---

Finally, the author touched on having mixed aged children when learning. I agree with the author's points. The beauty of homeschooling or educating kids of mixed ages in the same environment are:

ðŸŒ± Kids of different development levels can learn from each other

ðŸŒ± Older children learn to nurture and lead younger children

ðŸŒ± Younger children invoke creative-enhancing effects

_Free to Learn_ was a joy to read, and I highly recommend this book for those considering homeschooling or other alternative forms of education. For example, Prenda offers micro-schools, a wonderful option for providing a nurturing, caring environment for children to learn.

### Conclusion

---

As I look back on this year, my children and I have grown leaps and bounds. I will always remember 2020 as a year of growth and discovery - discovering our passions, growing in our independence as learners (both the children and mommy!), and espousing one of my favorite core values that Prenda holds - _learning over comfort_.

As I say _sayonara_ to 2020 and _hajimemashite_ to 2021, I anticipate what new exciting adventures lie ahead. Finally, thank you to everyone who inspired and encouraged me this year! I am so thankful for the fantastic people I have been blessed to interact with this year.

I look forward to working| learning | growing with you all in the coming year!
