Hello, and welcome! I'm so glad that you've decided to visit and hope you enjoy what you find here.
After many months of dreaming about creating my very own blog, here I am! I've finished my website
and am eager to share my new blog with you.

### Once Upon a Time, Not Too Long Ago‚Ä¶ üå†

---

I began my journey into the world of tech last winter (2019). My husband and I had decided to take a road trip to Chicago to visit the grandparents. We drove 13 hours straight with four children (driving at night worked great!) and safely reached our destination. Little did I know how my life would change during this road trip. During our week vacation, I decided I needed to make a drastic change in my life.

As a homeschooling mother of four children who also worked as a Japanese translator on the side, I did not lack in things to do. Neither did I dislike what I was doing at the time - I am super passionate about Japanese and LOVE that I get to homeschool my kids. However, I felt as if I was hitting a wall. Technology seemed to be evolving at the speed of light all around me, and I knew nothing about it. Japanese translation was a rewarding pursuit, but I made a little more than minimum wage doing work of which the future is uncertain. Up to that point, I had been a happy consumer of technology, but I could not suppress the little voice in my head that kept asking me, "wouldn't it be cool to create apps instead of just use them?" Although the thought of making a career change was more than a little daunting, I knew I would regret not trying to learn to program. So I began seeking ways to learn.

I had dabbled in the past with "creating" websites. In the past, I wanted to make a website for my daughter and her dog walking business. So I tried using Wix. Don't get me wrong. Website builder platforms like Wix or WordPress are an excellent way for people to make websites without having programming knowledge. However, as I tinkered with my daughter's website, I found myself wanting to understand MORE. I wanted to know how the Internet worked and how websites magically appear on computers. At that point, programming WAS like magic to me, and I wanted to start peeling away those layers of mystery to know what lay beneath.

### Learning How To Program üñ•Ô∏è

---

After searching for ways to start learning, my husband suggested I look into the program at **[Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/)**. What was appealing about Lambda School was the **[income share agreement](https://lambdaschool.com/tuition/isa)**, or ISA. That meant no tuition payments upfront and that I didn't start paying until I got a job making over a certain threshold. For a person like me who had already paid for college three times over (a bachelor's degree and two master's degrees), the ISA was VERY appealing.

I began my studies at Lambda School in December 2019. What followed were nine months of some of the most intensive learning I have done in my life. I'll be frank. For someone new to the world of programming, Lambda School is HARD. There were many times I questioned my ability to continue. "I can't do this!" I would lament (usually in tears of frustration) to my husband on several occasions. He assured me I would be fine, and I just needed to keep moving forward. "Whatever you do, don't give up." His repeated advice became my mantra as the months rolled on.

I completed the full-stack developer program and began my software internship at **[Prenda](https://prendaschool.com/)** this summer (2020). Some days I have to pinch myself to remember that I am not dreaming. I am working as a software engineer! I love the work I do now and wake up every morning, excited about the coding challenges I get to tackle. I have never felt as passionate about a career as I do in my current profession.

The amazing part is the journey to becoming a software engineer is I can still pursue other interests I am passionate about. Granted, I have less time to spend learning Japanese or homeschooling. However, that restricted time has forced me to be more deliberate with the time I have, cherishing each moment. Previously, I let homeschool drag on too long during the day. Far too often, I went too far in micromanaging my children's studies. Now, I give them a great deal of autonomy. Yes, I provide them with what they need to do and the resources necessary to get their studies done. What has changed is I have stopped handholding. I let them take responsibility for their learning, rather than carrying that responsibility entirely upon myself.

My children were at first a little confused by these changes. However, the result has been amazing to witness. They have grown to be more autonomous and independent. By giving them the freedom to learn how they choose to learn, they are developing skills they will use throughout their lifelong learning adventures.

### Like Magic ‚ú®

---

I started this blog to share my journey - however crazy, wild, and at times hectic it will be. I want to share because I hope to encourage anyone on the fence about taking on a new challenge. Remember - the sky's the limit! I am amazed every time I get a program to work or understand code I couldn't previously comprehend. That is why I named this blog Like Magic. Technology is a little bit like magic, where we get to dream about the impossible and make it a reality!

### The Ongoing Journey üå±

The worst thing you can do in life is to resign yourself to your current situation if you aren't content. It is never too late to start learning something new! Learning is an epic adventure, and I look forward to sharing my journey with each one of you. So, please join me in this adventure by subscribing to my blog~
