### My Blogging Journey Begins

<p>
  Hello world! I am so glad that you have decided to visit my blog. After many
  months of dreaming about creating my very own blog, here I am! I have finished
  my website and am eager to share my new blog with you.
</p>

### Once Upon a Time, Not Too Long Ago‚Ä¶ üå†

<p>
  I began my journey into the world of tech last winter (2019). My husband and I
  had decided to take a road trip to Chicago to visit the grandparents. We drove
  13 hours straight with four children (driving at night worked great!) and
  safely reached our destination. Little did I know how my life would change
  during this road trip. It was during our week vacation that I decided I needed
  to make a drastic change in my life.
</p>
<p>
  As a homeschooling mother of four children who also worked as a Japanese
  translator on the side, I was not lacking in things to do. Neither did I
  dislike what I was doing at the time - I am super passionate about Japanese
  and LOVE that I get to homeschool my kids. However, I felt as if I was hitting
  a wall. Technology seemed to be evolving at the speed of light all around me,
  and I knew nothing about it. Translation was a fine pursuit, but I was making
  a little more than minimum wage doing work of which the future is uncertain.
  Up to that point, I had been a happy consumer of technology, but I could not
  suppress the little voice in my head that kept asking me, ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt it be cool
  to create apps instead of just use them?‚Äù Although the thought of making a
  career change was more than a little daunting, I knew I would regret not
  trying to learn programming. So I began seeking for ways to learn.
</p>
<p>
  I had dabbled in the past with ‚Äúcreating‚Äù websites. In the past, I wanted to
  make a website for my daughter and her dog walking business. So I tried using
  Wix. Don't get me wrong. Companies like Wix are a great way for people to make
  websites without having programming knowledge. However, as I tinkered with my
  daughter's website, I found myself wanting to understand MORE. I wanted to
  understand the whole business of website creation. I wanted to understand more
  about how the Internet worked. At that point, programming was like magic to
  me, and I wanted to start peeling away those layers of mystery to know what
  lay beneath.
</p>

### Learning How To Program üñ•Ô∏è

<p>
  After searching for ways to start learning, my husband suggested I look into
  the program at{' '}
  <a href="https://lambdaschool.com/" alt="Lambda School website">
    Lambda School
  </a>
  . What was appealing about Lambda School was the <a
    href="https://lambdaschool.com/tuition/isa"
    alt="Lambda School income share agreement information"
  >
    income share agreement
  </a>, or ISA. That meant no tuition payments upfront and that I didn't start paying
  until I got a job making over a certain threshold. For a person like me who had
  already paid for college three times over (a bachelor's degree and two master's
  degrees), the ISA was VERY appealing.
</p>
<p>
  I began my studies at Lambda School in December 2019. What followed were nine
  months of some of the most intensive learning I have done in my life. I'll be
  frank. For someone new to the world of programming, Lambda School is{' '}
  <strong>HARD</strong>. There were many times I questioned my ability to
  continue. <i>"I can't do this!"</i> I would lament (usually in tears of
  frustration) to my husband on several occasions. He assured me I would be
  fine, and I just needed to keep moving forward. "Whatever you do, don't give
  up." His repeated advice became my mantra as the months rolled on.
</p>
<p>
  I successfully completed the Lambda School full-stack developer program and
  began my software internship at{' '}
  <a href="https://prendaschool.com/" alt="Prenda website">
    Prenda
  </a>{' '}
  this summer (2020). Some days I have to pinch myself to remember that I am not
  dreaming. I really am working as a software engineer! I love the work I do now
  and wake up every morning excited about the coding challenges I get to tackle.
  I have never felt as passionate about a career as I do in my current
  profession.
</p>
<p>
  The cool part is the journey to becoming a software engineer is I can still
  pursue other interests I am passionate about. Granted, I have less time to
  spend learning Japanese or homeschooling. However, that restricted time has
  forced me to be more deliberate with the time I do have, cherishing each
  moment. Previously, I let homeschool drag on too long during the day. Far too
  often, I went too far in micromanaging my children's studies. Now, I give them
  a great deal of autonomy. Yes, I provide them with what they need to do and
  the resources necessary to get their studies done. What has changed is I have
  stopped handholding. I let them take responsibility for their learning, rather
  than carrying that responsibility entirely upon myself.
</p>
<p>
  My children were at first a little confused by these changes. However, the
  result has been amazing to witness. They have grown to be more autonomous and
  independent. By giving them the freedom to learn how they choose to learn,
  they are developing skills they will use throughout their lifelong learning
  adventures.
</p>

### Like Magic ‚ú®

<p>
  I started this blog to share my journey - however crazy, wild, and at times
  hectic it will be. I want to share because I hope to encourage anyone on the
  fence about taking on a new challenge. Remember - the sky's the limit! I am
  amazed every time I get a program to work, or understand code I just couldn't
  comprehend before. That is why I this blog is called{' '}
  <strong>Like Magic</strong>. Technology is a little bit like magic, where we
  get to dream about the impossible and make it a reality!
</p>

### The Ongoing Journey üå±

<p>
  The worst thing we can do in life is to resign ourselves to our current
  situation if we are not content. It is never too late to start learning
  something new! Learning is an epic adventure, and I look forward to both
  sharing my journey and also hearing about the journeys of each reader as well.
  So, please join me in this adventure of achieving the impossible by
  subscribing to my blog! I would love to have you along on the journey~
