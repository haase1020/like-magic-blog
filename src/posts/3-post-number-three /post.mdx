  Fourth Birthday: Reflections from a Mom in Tech
</h3>

<section className ="mdx-page" >

Today is my youngest child's fourth birthday. Four years ago, he came into this world at a whopping three pounds, gracing our family with his presence two months before we anticipated. Life has never been the same.

My son has three older siblings, and we have been homeschooling from the start. My oldest son was born in Japan, so we homeschool our children bilingually. In my previous career, I worked as a Japanese translator. After attending Lambda School, I switched to becoming a software engineer last year, a full-stack developer boot camp.

As I reflect on the past four years with my youngest son, I would like to share the incredible journey it has been.

That cold (relatively speaking - we lived in Hawaii at the time) January day is a day I will never forget. After a month of being hospitalized and then released, I was in the hospital again because the baby in my belly didn't seem to be doing well. His heartbeat was irregular, and the doctors were concerned. I was a mess. The doctors had told me I was prematurely dilated at 28 weeks. Yikes. So I was hospitalized for about a week. After no changes and the baby seeming to be just fine, I decided to go home to be with my children and husband, who was close to his wit's ends dealing with a household of kids and working full-time.

Unfortunately, things took a turn for the worse. After being hospitalized again, on the evening of January 7, 2017, my son came into the world. At a little over three pounds, he was a REALLY tiny bundle of joy. He was immediately whisked away to the NICU after being born, leaving my husband and me with this strange sense of emptiness. Having been through labor and delivery three times before, this time was so very different. There was no baby in my arms to cuddle after hours of labor. There was no sense of relief and joy. Instead, I was haunted by an uncontrollable fear. Yes, my son had been safely born, and although his heart had stopped briefly after birth, the doctors had successfully resuscitated him, and he was in a stable condition. I should be overjoyed. Right? I wasn't. I was petrified. Would he make it through the night? What next?

What followed was two months of being in limbo. My son was a trooper - although born two months early, he had no significant complications. I was able to provide breast milk too, so I began my twice a day commute to the hospital to check in on my son and drop off the latest milk supply.

Since I was pumping breast milk around the clock, I quickly entered sleep deprivation mode. I was paranoid about sanitizing everything to prevent infection (unfortunately, my family contracted the flu right before my son was born). My life became dictated by a two-hour cycle of sterilizing, pumping, and commuting to the hospital. I was running on fumes.

I tried to keep some normalcy with my other children. We continued homeschooling, but I was so sleep deprived that I don't remember much during that time. My children were super resilient and encouraging, but I could tell all of this was taking a toll on them as well.

<h3 className="mdx-subtitle">Dealing with Fear</h3>

During this time, I spent a lot of time living in fear. What if my baby doesn't make it? It's all my fault! I should have stayed in the hospital instead of coming homeâ€¦. I was plagued with a severe case of "if only I hadâ€¦". NOT a good place to be.

<h3 className="mdx-subtitle">Dealing with Depression</h3>

---

I also dealt with depression during this time. What was the point? My older children were suffering. My new baby might not make it. My husband was also running on fumes. Life just seemed so HARD. I spent a ton of time just crying in desperation and exhaustion.

<h3 className="mdx-subtitle">Turn for the Better</h3>

---

Finally, two months later, my son was discharged from the hospital and started life with the rest of his siblings. Of course, being discharged didn't mean life suddenly became easy. My son was no longer hooked to monitors supervised by nurses 24-7. It was up to me to make sure he didn't stop breathing during his naps and that he was successfully eating and gaining weight. If I thought I had been sleep deprived before, boy was I wrong! I was so afraid of sleeping at night I would stay up, watching my son's little chest move up and down as he slept contentedly. My husband would come home from work and watch my son while I would pass out for a couple of hours to get ready for the next long night ahead. Nothing like sleep deprivation for a while to make you REALLY appreciate the blessing of sleep.

So, what has my son taught me? How has this helped me in my profession? The following are the key lessons I have learned:

ðŸŒ± Resilience:

I have learned the power of doing what needs to be done. Complaining about things doesn't make them better. Yes, there will be times when you can change your circumstances. But sometimes, you just can't. You have to learn how to work with what you are given.

ðŸŒ± Adaptation:

I continued to homeschool my children during months of tough times, dealing with a ton of really difficult stuff. I learned to tweak my teaching and learning materials so my children could learn more independently.

ðŸŒ±The Beauty of Asking for Help:

I have always been a stubbornly independent person. This independent spirit often serves me well since I seek ways to accomplish things on my own without relying on others to come to the rescue. However,
sometimes you need to have the humility to ask for help. Especially in tech, there is SO much to know and learn that you can't be an expert at it all. You need to learn the art of WHEN to ask for help and accept that help graciously.

ðŸŒ± Thankfulness:

Having witnessed a near-death experience with my son, I have learned that being thankful for the little things is the key to finding joy in life. Before my son was born, I would complain about the most trivial things (I would like to say I don't do that anymore, but that would be a lie. Old habits die hard). I would complain about things that, in the big scheme of things, DON'T MATTER. Nothing like a huge trial to make you hone in on what is important in life. I like to keep a gratitude journal now. I write down all the things I am thankful for. Here is a small sample:

âœ… Walking with my husband in the morning

âœ… Learning with my kids

âœ… Getting to spend each day with my kids

âœ… Grandparents that are willing to Zoom with my kids daily to help with studies

âœ… Having a job so I can help my husband provide for the family

âœ… Having money to buy necessities

Happy Birthday, my dear son!

I am so thankful for the past four years, and everything my son and family have taught me. I am overjoyed every day I get to spend with my family, and look forward to the adventures that lie ahead. As I continue on my journey as a software engineer, I am excited to help be a friend and mentor to my children on their journeys as well.
