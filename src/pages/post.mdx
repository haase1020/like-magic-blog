## My Blogging Journey Begins

## Introduction

I began my journey into the world of tech last winter (2019).
My husband and I had decided to take a road trip to Chicago to visit the grandparents.
We drove 13 hours straight with four children (driving at night worked great!) and safely
reached our destination. It was during our week vacation that I decided I needed to make
a change in my life.

As a homeschooling mother of four children who also worked as a Japanese translator on the side,
I was not lacking in things to do. Neither did I dislike what I was doing at the time - I am super
passionate about Japanese and LOVE that I get to homeschool my kids.
However, I felt as if I was hitting a wall. Technology seemed to be evolving at the speed of
light all around me, and I hardly knew what it was all about. Up to that point,
I had been a happy consumer of technology, but that wasn't enough for me.
I wanted to make the transition to also being a producer of technology. So I began seeking.
